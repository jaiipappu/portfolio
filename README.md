# Data Science & Research Portfolio

## Hey there, nice to meet you! Thanks for dropping by and checking out my portfolio. Let me introduce myself!  
- As a final-year Neuroscience Honors student at Boston University, I've specialized in data science and research methodologies. Throughout my academic journey, I've delved deeply into the dynamic realm of data analysis, software methodologies, and impactful research techniques. My passion lies in harnessing a diverse toolkit of data-driven approaches to unveil profound insights, steering strategic decision-making. Outside of this exciting world, you'll find me travelling and exploring new countries, scrolling through TikTok for the latest trends and memes, and discovering cozy coffee shops around Boston. With a robust background in research and a keen eye for deciphering complex data, I'm eager to channel these skills and enthusiasm into roles centered on Data Analytics, Consulting, & Product Management.

#### Technical Skills: Python, MATLAB, R, PostgreSQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Salesforce, ImageJ, Snapgene, Jira

## Professional Experiences 
**Associate Product Manager Co-op, Healthcare Data Analytics Team@ JVR Systems (_August 2023 - Present_)**
***Unveiling Insights in Healthcare Data***
- As an Associate Product Manager, my role involves delving into healthcare data analytics. Through intensive market research, I contributed pivotal insights shaping a user-centric telemedicine platform. Collaborating closely with my team, we've sculpted functionalities aimed at addressing critical needs within the healthcare landscape. Leveraging data-driven solutions, I've been instrumental in driving advancements that promise impactful changes in healthcare technology.

**Spatial Morbidity Co-occurrence Project Lead@ Boston University School of Public Health (_December 2021 - Present_)**
***Data-Driven Insights for Societal Challenges***
- My contributions at the Research on Innovations for Safety & Equity Lab, within BU School of Public Health, have played a pivotal role in addressing societal challenges. Spearheading a $5,415 research grant project investigating the spatial co-occurrence of firearm violence, opioid overdoses, and COVID-19 deaths in Chicago, I utilized R to analyze intricate datasets. The results revealed a stark imbalance in fatalities, disproportionately impacting marginalized communities. These findings advocate strongly for data-driven solutions to tackle societal issues head-on.

**Biosafety Level-2 Virology Researcher@ National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory (_December 2022 - Present_)**
***Exploring Virology & Cutting-Edge Biotechnology***
- Within the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory at BU School of Medicine, I've been on an exciting exploration into the world of viruses. Awarded $6,000 in a BU Research Grant, I successfully engineered an infectious recombinant West Nile Virus expressing Green Fluorescent Protein, enabling enhanced visualization of infection processes in mammalian and mosquito cells. This study is just the beginning of my quest to understand more about how West Nile Virus and other neurotropic viruses spread and its effects on the brain using innovative techniques in a lab setting.

**Clinical Research Assistant/Data Analyst@ BU Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation (_March 2022 - January 2023_)**
***Clinical Research and Data Analytics in Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Engineering***
- As an NREMT-Certified Clinical Research Assistant and Data Analyst at the STEPP Lab for Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Engineering, I've been deeply involved in investigating how vocal hyperfunction and testosterone influence speech patterns in transgender patients. My responsibilities encompassed conducting extensive research, where I meticulously analyzed over 1000 vocal recordings using Praat software and delved into comprehensive data analysis with MATLAB. Moreover, my role extended beyond research. I served as an on-call NREMT during clinical patient trials, ensuring the safety and well-being of participants throughout our research experiments. This dedication resulted in a flawless safety record, prioritizing the utmost care and security of those involved in our studies.

**Outside of the Classroom**
- Beyond my academic pursuits, I've embraced a spectrum of roles focused on growth and empowerment. At BU, I welcomed prospective students as an admissions ambassador, offering informative campus tours and insights into university life. I've dedicated over 100 hours as a mentor, guiding high school students through the complexities of the college admissions process in the FUTURO program. Additionally, I've taken an active role in updating and managing student databases using Salesforce software, ensuring accurate academic and contact information for program participants.

My dedication to financial literacy led me to lead a Student Personal Finance Workshop, equipping inner-city high school juniors with essential financial management skills. Moreover, I've passionately engaged in STEM education, closely guiding inner-city children in Trenton through robotics and engineering using Legos, fostering analytical thinking and igniting a passion for technology. This extended to teaching diverse software, robotics, and engineering courses and organizing engaging summer camps for children of various age groups.

Within the realm of neurobiology, pharmacology, and data analysis, I've contributed as a research assistant on a study exploring the effects of fluoxetine (Prozac) on Potassium 2-pore Channels in Crayfish Motor Axons. This investigation seeks to understand neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, exploring its potential correlation with depression and mood disorders.

Among these responsibilities, I've played a pivotal role in cultivating inclusive communities as a Residential Assistant. Overseeing a community of over 900 residents, I've actively managed conflicts, enforced policies, and ensured access to resources for both academic and social well-being. My efforts were dedicated to fostering a supportive environment that nurtured personal growth and community cohesion.
