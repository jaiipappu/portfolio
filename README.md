***Clinical Research and Data Analytics in Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Engineering:***
- As an NREMT-Certified Clinical Research Assistant and Data Analyst at the STEPP Lab for Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Engineering, I've been deeply involved in investigating how vocal hyperfunction and testosterone influence speech patterns in transgender patients. My responsibilities encompassed conducting extensive research, where I meticulously analyzed over **1000** vocal recordings using Praat software and delved into comprehensive data analysis with MATLAB. Moreover, my role extended beyond research. I served as an on-call NREMT during clinical patient trials, ensuring the safety and well-being of participants throughout our research experiments. This dedication resulted in a flawless safety record, prioritizing the utmost care and security of those involved in our studies.

## Projects
### Hospital Emergency Room Visits Dashboard
[Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/HospitalEmergencyRoomVisitsDashboard/ERDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This hospital ER dashboard harnesses **SQL** to manage and analyze hospital emergency room visits, utilizing sample data from Real World Fake Data, ensuring compliance with patient privacy and HIPAA standards. The comprehensive tool provides healthcare professionals and administrators with a real-time, granular view of ER traffic, patient demographics, and visit nature.

By leveraging **Tableau** for visualization, the dashboard presents crucial metrics like patient traffic, peak hours, department referrals, patient satisfaction, and demographic patterns. These visualizations empower healthcare decision-makers by offering insights for optimized resource allocation, staffing, and facility readiness. The dashboard's analytics aid in forecasting and managing patient influxes, thus elevating emergency room efficiency and patient care.

This project stands as an invaluable asset for healthcare institutions, utilizing SQL and Tableau to drive informed decision-making. It facilitates improved ER workflows, enables prompt addressing of patient needs, and ultimately enhances the quality of emergency medical services.

### COVID-19 Global Vaccination Tracker 
[Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19GlobalVaccinationTracker_17004592774720/COVIDVaccineTracker?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This dashboard monitors the progress of global COVID-19 vaccination campaigns while delving into the correlation between countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and vaccination penetration rates. Additionally, this tool provides a dynamic visualization via **Tableau** of vaccination efforts worldwide which offers stakeholders a nuanced understanding of how economic factors might influence vaccination uptake and analyzes the intersection of public health strategies, demographics, and economic indicators amidst the pandemic.
